# Assignment - Mobile Data Analysis with SQL and Python

This repository contains:
- **Assignment.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook with Python solutions and queries.  
- **mobile.txt**: SQL insert statements for a dataset of mobile phones (Apple, Samsung, POCO, etc.) with details such as model, RAM, ROM, battery, processor, price, and ratings.  

## Contents
The notebook demonstrates:
- Importing and handling structured data  
- Executing SQL queries on the mobile dataset  
- Filtering, searching, and analyzing records  
- Performing update and delete operations  
- Insights based on attributes like price, RAM, ROM, and ratings  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- SQLite / MySQL (or any SQL engine supported)  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `sqlite3` / `sqlalchemy` (depending on implementation)  

## Usage
1. Clone this repository  
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed  
3. Import the `mobile.txt` dataset into your SQL engine  
4. Open `Assignment.ipynb` and run the cells step by step  
5. Explore mobile dataset queries and results  

## Dataset Example
The dataset includes entries such as:  
- **Apple iPhone SE** – 5G, 2GB RAM, 64GB ROM, Price: ₹32,999, Rating: 4.5  
- **Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus** – 5G, 8GB RAM, 128GB ROM, Price: ₹73,999, Rating: 4.3  
- **POCO M3** – 5G, 6GB RAM, 64GB ROM, Price: ₹10,999, Rating: 4.3
